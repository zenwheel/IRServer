A server to generate IR commands from an HTTP request.  The interface is simply:

http://<host>/send?freq=<##>&data=<list>

where ## is the carrier frequency of the IR signal in kHz (i.e. 38)
and list is a comma delimited list of on/off signal timing in microseconds (i.e. 9000,4000,600,600,300,600...)

This makes use of Ken Shirriff's IRremote library: http://github.com/zenwheel/Arduino-IRremote
and webduino for the web server: http://code.google.com/p/webduino/

I've also written a module for lirc which can perform the HTTP request from a lirc device driver: http://github.com/zenwheel/lirc
